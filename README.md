### Author:

### What the project does?

This is an app built with React. The game takes in user clicks on images, and outputs reshuffled images, messages, and user scores. The goal of the game is to not click on any image more than once, despite the images being shuffled after each click. The user needs to memorize the cards he/she has clicked on in order to achieve highest score.
